### Prerequisites
Make sure you have all the [prerequisites](https://github.com/CSharpGodotTools/Template/wiki/Setup#prerequisites) then create a new fork of this repository and clone it with `git clone --recursive <your-repo-url>`.

If you need help with setting up an IDE, see the setup guides I've made for [Visual Studio](https://github.com/CSharpGodotTools/Template/wiki/Setup-Visual-Studio) and [GitHub Desktop App](https://github.com/CSharpGodotTools/Template/wiki/Working-with-GitHub-Desktop).

### Low File Size
This project should be as lightweight as possible so it will not include any game assets. For example an FPS scene with 4K textures is too large and as such should be developed in a separate repository. Such repositories if any exist will be mentioned in the projects [README.md](https://github.com/CSharpGodotTools/Template/blob/main/README.md).

### Contributing
Have a brief look at the projects [Code Style Document](https://github.com/CSharpGodotTools/Template/wiki/Code-Style-Document).

See if there are any [good first issues](https://github.com/CSharpGodotTools/Template/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22), these issues will always be beginner friendly. You can also have a look at the [discussions](https://github.com/CSharpGodotTools/Template/discussions).
