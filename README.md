## Contributing
Please have a look at the [Projects Coding Style](https://github.com/Valks-Games/sankari/wiki/Code-Style).

I highly recommend you install the [GitHub Desktop App](https://desktop.github.com/). This will almost completely eliminate the need to do Git CLI commands through the command line.

If you are interested in contributing or have any questions please talk to `va#9904` over Discord.
