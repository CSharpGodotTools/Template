First complete the [setup](https://github.com/CSharpGodotTools/Template/wiki/Setup).

Setup an IDE like [Visual Studio](https://github.com/CSharpGodotTools/Template/wiki/Setup-Visual-Studio) and install [GitHub Desktop App](https://github.com/CSharpGodotTools/Template/wiki/Working-with-GitHub-Desktop).

Normally, when setting up a new project using this template, you would run the main scene and complete the setup, but doing so modifies and deletes several files. So we should avoid doing this because we don't want to commit files changed by the setup.

Please have a brief look at the projects [Code Style Document](https://github.com/ValksGodotTools/Template/wiki/Code-Style-Document).
