# Template
I was tired of doing the same things over and over again for each new game I started working on. So that's what this template is for, something that I can use in all my games as a starting point. See the [roadmap](https://github.com/ValksGodotTools/Template/issues/1) for planned features.

## Setup
1. Download and install the [latest Godot 4 C# release](https://godotengine.org/)
2. Clone this repository with all its submodules
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ValksGodotTools/Template
```

## Contributing
Please have a look at the [Projects Coding Style](https://github.com/Valks-Games/sankari/wiki/Code-Style).

I highly recommend you install the [GitHub Desktop App](https://desktop.github.com/). This will almost completely eliminate the need to do Git CLI commands through the command line.

If you are interested in contributing or have any questions please talk to `va#9904` over Discord.
