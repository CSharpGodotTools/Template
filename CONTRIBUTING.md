### Prerequisites
First complete the [setup](https://github.com/CSharpGodotTools/Template/wiki/Setup).

Check out these setup guides I've made for [Visual Studio](https://github.com/CSharpGodotTools/Template/wiki/Setup-Visual-Studio) and [GitHub Desktop App](https://github.com/CSharpGodotTools/Template/wiki/Working-with-GitHub-Desktop).

Have a brief look at the projects [Code Style Document](https://github.com/ValksGodotTools/Template/wiki/Code-Style-Document).

### Scope
The current scope of this project is to provide a full multiplayer solution, extensive debugging tools and scripts to streamline game development. 

This template will be as lightweight as possible so it will not include any game assets. For example an FPS scene with 4K textures is too large and as such would be developed in a separate repository. Such repositories if any exist will be mentioned in the projects [README.md](https://github.com/CSharpGodotTools/Template/blob/main/README.md).

### Contributing
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Normally, when setting up a new project using this template, you would run the main scene and click 'Apply changes', but doing so modifies and deletes several files. So we should avoid doing this because we don't want to commit files changed by the setup.

Ready to start contributing? Start by looking to see if there are any [good first issues](https://github.com/CSharpGodotTools/Template/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22), these issues will always be beginner friendly.
