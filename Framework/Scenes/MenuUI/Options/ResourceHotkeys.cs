 * If the ResourceHotkeys.cs script is moved then the file path will not updated

 * and delete the .tres file so Godot will be forced to generate it from
 * scratch. This is not a Godot bug it is just something to look out for.
 * 
 * Resource props must have [Export] attribute otherwise they will not save 
 * properly.
 * 
 * The 'recommended' way of storing config files can be found here
 * https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_configfile.html
 * However this is undesired because values are saved through string keys
 * instead of props.
