# Template
I was tired of doing the same things over and over again for each new game I started working on. So that's what this template is for, something that I can use in all my games as a starting point.

## Roadmap
- Credits scene that you can scroll up / down and pause / resume
- Hotkey management
- ModLoader logic and UI
- Clicking on Options in popup menu should take user to some kind of options scene (would be nice if used the same script to add the options)

## Setup
1. Download and install the [latest Godot 4 C# release](https://godotengine.org/)
2. Clone this repository with all its submodules
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ValksGodotTools/Template
```

## Contributing
Please have a look at the [Projects Coding Style](https://github.com/Valks-Games/sankari/wiki/Code-Style).

I highly recommend you install the [GitHub Desktop App](https://desktop.github.com/). This will almost completely eliminate the need to do Git CLI commands through the command line.

If you are interested in contributing or have any questions please talk to `va#9904` over Discord.
